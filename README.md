# "Open World" submod for Monika After Story:

This mod allows you to take Monika back into her world after she deleted everything at the end of **Doki Doki Literature Club**. Not only that but you can click certain things in the environment and she'll take a look at it. However, because of her deletion, some corruption and some bugs will appear as you explore the world with her

# BETA TEST:
This is just a beta test and everything is subject to change
